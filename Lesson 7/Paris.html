    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p  id="p1"  class="1">
        Paris, the capital of France, is a very popular tourist attraction in Europe. Paris is home to the Eiffel Tower, a big, beautiful tower built in the late 1880's. Every year, the Eiffel Tower gets approximately 6-7 million vistitors. Paris also can proudly claim the Louvre Museum to be it's own. The Louvre Museum holds some of the world's most iconic pieces including artworks, sculptures and much more.

<h3>Fashion in Paris</h3>
<p    id="p2"   class="1">
    Paris has been the fashion capital of the Western world from the seventeenth century to the twenty-first century, although other cities, such as New York, London, and Milan, also have become important centers of fashion. The clothes we wear today owe a great deal to Paris, even if they were designed (and almost certainly manufactured) elsewhere in the world.
